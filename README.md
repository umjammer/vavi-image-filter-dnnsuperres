[BufferedImageOp](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/awt/image/BufferedImageOp.html)
using pretrained models to OpenCV's DNNSuperRes

this is a fork of https://github.com/Araxeus/PNG-Upscale

## Install

https://jitpack.io/#umjammer/vavi-image-filter-dnnsuperres

```shell
 $ mvn -P lwjgl-natives-macos-amd64 -Djavacpp.platform=macosx-x86_64 install
```

## Usage

```java
    DNNSuperResolutionOp filter = new DNNSuperResolutionOp(DNNSuperResolutionOp.MODES[0]);
    BufferedImage image = ImageIO.read(Files.newInputStream(in));
    BufferedImage filteredImage = filter.filter(image, null);
    ImageIO.write(filteredImage, "PNG", Files.newOutputStream(out));
```

## Models

There are four trained models integrated into the program :

### EDSR 
##### `[Best Quality]+[Slowest]`

- Size of the model: ~38.5MB x3. This is a quantized version, so that it can be uploaded to GitHub. (Original was 150MB each.)
- This model was trained for 3 days with a batch size of 16
- Link to implementation code: https://github.com/Saafke/EDSR_Tensorflow
- x2, x3, x4 trained models available
- Advantage: <ins>*Highly accurate*</ins>
- Disadvantage: <ins>*Slow*</ins> and large filesize
- Speed: < 3 sec for every scaling factor on 256x256 images on an Intel i7-9700K CPU.
- Original paper: [Enhanced Deep Residual Networks for Single Image Super-Resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02921.pdf) [1]

> Trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Saafke/EDSR_Tensorflow/tree/master/models).

### ESPCN
##### `[Fast]`

- Size of the model: ~100kb x3
- This model was trained for ~100 iterations with a batch size of 32
- Link to implementation code: https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-ESPCN
- x2, x3, x4 trained models available
- Advantage: It is tiny and fast, and still performs well.
- Disadvantage: Perform worse visually than newer, more robust models.
- Speed: < 0.01 sec for every scaling factor on 256x256 images on an Intel i7-9700K CPU.
- Original paper: [Real-Time Single Image and Video Super-Resolution Using an Efficient Sub-Pixel Convolutional Neural Network](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02921.pdf) [2]

> Trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-ESPCN/tree/master/export).

### FSRCNN
##### `[Fast]`

- Size of the model: ~40KB x3
- This model was trained for ~30 iterations with a batch size of 1
- Link to implementation code: https://github.com/Saafke/FSRCNN_Tensorflow
- Advantage: Fast, small and accurate
- Disadvantage: Not state-of-the-art accuracy
- Speed: < 0.01 sec for every scaling factor on 256x256 images on an Intel i7-9700K CPU.
- Notes: FSRCNN-small has fewer parameters, thus less accurate but faster.
- Original paper: [Accelerating the Super-Resolution Convolutional Neural Network](http://mmlab.ie.cuhk.edu.hk/projects/FSRCNN.html) [3]

> Trained models can be downloaded from [here](https://github.com/Saafke/FSRCNN_Tensorflow/tree/master/models).

### LapSRN
##### `[Has x8]`

- Size of the model: between 1-5Mb x3
- This model was trained for ~50 iterations with a batch size of 32
- Link to implementation code: https://github.com/fannymonori/TF-LAPSRN
- x2, x4, x8 trained models available
- Advantage: The model can do multi-scale super-resolution with one forward pass. It can now support 2x, 4x, 8x, and [2x, 4x] and [2x, 4x, 8x] super-resolution.
- Disadvantage: It is slower than ESPCN and FSRCNN, and the accuracy is worse than EDSR.
- Speed: < 0.1 sec for every scaling factor on 256x256 images on an Intel i7-9700K CPU.
- Original paper: [Deep laplacian pyramid networks for fast and accurate super-resolution](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1707.02921.pdf) [4]
